<!-- I obtained my PhD degree in applied numerical computing from the School of Mathematics of the University of Manchester in December 2010. During January 2011 to June 2012, I was a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Maryland, College Park. During July 2012 to February 2015, I was a postdoc at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I joined the faculty of the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University as an assistant professor, PI in March 2015.After joining SIST, my research focuses on efficient numerical methods for PDEs with high-dimensional random inputs, and -->
Our Lab's reasearch focus on scientific computing, including the following directions: partial differential equations(PDEs), tensor methods, deep learning for PDEs, Bayesian inverse problems, random numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, uncertainty quantification. My work is supported by the National Natural Science of China and Shanghai Young East Scholar.
